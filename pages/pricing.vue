								<p>All of the examples in Tailwind UI are provided in three formats: React, Vue, and vanilla HTML.</p>
								<p>The React and Vue examples are fully functional out-of-the-box, and are powered by <a href="https://headlessui.dev">Headless UI</a> — a library of unstyled components we designed to integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.</p>
								<p>The vanilla HTML examples <strong>do not include any JavaScript</strong> and are designed for people who prefer to write any necessary JavaScript themselves.</p>
								<p>Most of the components do not rely on JS at all, but for the ones that do (dropdowns, modals, etc.) we've provided some simple comments in the HTML to explain things like what classes you need use for different states (like a toggle switch being on or off), or what classes we recommend for transitioning elements on to or off of the screen (like a modal opening).</p>

							<h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What JS framework does Tailwind UI use?</h3>
							<div class="prose prose-sm leading-5">
								<p>All of the examples in Tailwind UI are provided in three formats: React, Vue, and vanilla HTML.</p>
								<p>The React and Vue examples are fully functional out-of-the-box, and are powered by <a href="https://headlessui.dev">Headless UI</a> — a library of unstyled components we designed to integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.</p>
								<p>The vanilla HTML examples <strong>do not include any JavaScript</strong> and are designed for people who prefer to write any necessary JavaScript themselves.</p>
								<p>Most of the components do not rely on JS at all, but for the ones that do (dropdowns, modals, etc.) we've provided some simple comments in the HTML to explain things like what classes you need use for different states (like a toggle switch being on or off), or what classes we recommend for transitioning elements on to or off of the screen (like a modal opening).</p>
